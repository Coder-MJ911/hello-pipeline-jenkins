## Pipeline
A Pipeline is a user-defined model of a CD pipeline. A Pipelineâ€™s code defines your entire build process, which typically includes stages for building an application, testing it and then delivering it.

Also, a pipeline block is a key part of Declarative Pipeline syntax.

## Node
A node is a machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and is capable of executing a Pipeline.

Also, a node block is a key part of Scripted Pipeline syntax.

## Stage
A stage block defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire Pipeline (e.g. "Build", "Test" and "Deploy" stages), which is used by many plugins to visualize or present Jenkins Pipeline status/progress. [6]

## Step
A single task. Fundamentally, a step tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time (or "step" in the process). For example, to execute the shell command make use the sh step: sh 'make'. When a plugin extends the Pipeline DSL, [1] that typically means the plugin has implemented a new step.

## Pipeline syntax overview
The following Pipeline code skeletons illustrate the fundamental differences between Declarative Pipeline syntax and Scripted Pipeline syntax.

Be aware that both stages and steps (above) are common elements of both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline syntax.

## Declarative Pipeline fundamentals
In Declarative Pipeline syntax, the pipeline block defines all the work done throughout your entire Pipeline.

## Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
```shell script
pipeline {
    agent any 
    stages {
        stage('Build') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
    }
}
```
